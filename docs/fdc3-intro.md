The mission of the Financial Desktop Connectivity and Collaboration Consortium (FDC3) is to develop specific protocols and taxonomies to advance the ability of desktop applications in financial workflows to interoperate in a plug-and-play fashion, without prior bi-lateral agreements.

FDC3 provides an **open standard for interoperability** between applications on the financial desktop.

This includes standardized verbs to invoke actions between applications (called "intents"), a standardized data format, a REST-based app directory standard, and standardized API operations.

## Motivation

FDC3 codifies standard patterns that application developers have been using for cross-application workflows between web and native applications
in the financial industry.

For more information, see [Why FDC3](why-fdc3).
## Specifications

The standard currently consists of four complementary specifications:

- [API](api/spec)
- [Intents](intents/spec)
- [Context Data](context/spec)
- [App Directory](app-directory/spec)

## Use Cases

From its inception, the standards have been informed by real-world [business use cases](use-cases/overview), which you can view on this website,
and form an important part of FDC3.
## Who is using FDC3?

FDC3 was launched in October 2017 by [OpenFin](http://www.openfin.co) in collaboration with [major industry participants](/users). It includes representatives from over 40 major banks, buy-side firms, consultancies and financial services platforms.

## How is FDC3 governed?

FDC3 is hosted within, and governed by the policies of, the [Fintech Open Source Foundation](http://finos.org/) (FINOS). FINOS is an independent nonprofit organization focused on promoting open innovation within financial services.

See the [FDC3 Charter](fdc3-charter#licensing) for details of how deliverables are licensed.
