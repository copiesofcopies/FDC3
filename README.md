FDC3 aims to provide an open standard for interoperability on the financial desktop. This includes standardized verbs to invoke actions between applications (called "intents"), a standardized data format, an OpenAPI app directory standard, and standardized API operations.

The standard currently consists of four specifications:

1. [API Specification](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/spec)
2. [Intents Specification](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/intents/spec)
3. [Context Data Specification](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/context/spec)
4. [App Directory Specification](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/app-directory/spec)

The specifications are informed by agreed [business use cases](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/use-cases/overview),
and implemented and used by leading [financial industry participants](https://fdc3.finos.org/users).

See https://fdc3.finos.org for more information, including on [compliance] and the [FDC3 charter], as well as a comprehensive [API Reference].

[FDC3 Charter]: https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/fdc3-charter
[Compliance]: https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/fdc3-compliance
[API Reference]: https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/api/ref/DesktopAgent

# Supported Platforms

As an open standard, FDC3 can be implemented on any platform and in any language.

All that is required is a "desktop agent" that supports the FDC3 standard, which is responsible for co-ordinating application interactions.

## Web

For web applications to be FDC3-enabled, they need to run in the context of an agent that makes the FDC3 API available to the application. This desktop agent is also responsible for lauching and co-ordinating applications. It could be a browser extension, web app, or full-fledged desktop container framework.

### Example

```ts
// declare FDC3-compliant data
const instrument = {
    type: 'fdc3.instrument',
    id: {
        ticker: 'AAPL',
        ISIN: 'US0378331005',
        FIGI : 'BBG000B9XRY4'
    }
}

// invoke an action in another application, with the required data
const result = await fdc3.raiseIntent('ViewAnalysis', instrument)

// join the red channel and broadcast data to subscribers
await fdc3.joinChannel('red')
fdc3.broadcast(instrument)

// set up a listener for incoming data
const listener = fdc3.addContextListener('fdc3.contact', contact => { })
```

### Installation

To access the APIs in your application, simply install the FDC3 npm package:

```sh
# npm
npm install @finos/fdc3

# yarn
yarn add @finos/fdc3

# pnpm
pnpm install @finos/fdc3
```

Note that the web application still needs to run in the context of an FDC3 desktop agent to work. For more details, please see the [relevant documentation](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/supported-platforms).

### Usage

FDC3 can be accessed either via the global window object:

```ts
if (window.fdc3) {
  const channel = await window.fdc3.getOrCreateChannel('myChannel')
  channel.broadcast({ ... })
}
```

Or by importing relevant FDC3 functions with ES6 module syntax:

```ts
import { getOrCreateChannel } from '@finos/fdc3'

// will throw if window.fdc3 is not available
const channel = await getOrCreateChannel('myChannel')
channel.broadcast({ ... })
```

## Native
The FDC3 standard does not define wire formats for communication. Hence, for native applications to be FDC3-enabled, they need to make use of a library (e.g. a DLL in .Net or Jar file in Java) that provides them with an implementation of the FDC3 API. FDC3-enabled native applications are therefore specific to particular desktop container frameworks (or other suitable environments) that provide the necessary libraries.

Despite this limitation, implementing support for FDC3 in a native application can allow it to interact with a wide variety of FDC3-enabled web applications.

# Roadmap

- [x] Publish versioned NPM packages to ease adoption and implementation of FDC3 APIs.
- [x] Release version 1.2 of the standard with expanded API capabilities.
- [ ] Establish a process to accelerate community-contributed context data definitions.
- [ ] Release version 2.0 of the standard with support for app instances, two-way data flow and joining multiple channels.
- [ ] Improve the app directory specification, with support for container-agnostic app manifests, and more type metadata around channels and launching apps.
- [ ] Introduce a hosted app directory example with sample application definitions.
- [ ] Continue building out business use cases to inform future versions of the FDC3 Standard.

# Using the standard? Let us know!
